      <description>In security, there are always tensions; the balancing act between security, convenience, and functionality. While these three, often competing interests cause many people to become frustrated, there are some simple steps that can ease the security struggle: Any Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) is better than no MFA. Any password manager is better than not using one. Determine your current level...</description>

      <title>Tripwire and Fortra: Helping Secure IT and OT Environments Better than Ever</title>
      <link>https://www.tripwire.com/state-of-security/tripwire-and-fortra-helping-secure-it-and-ot-environments-better-ever</link>
      <description>When I was younger, you could add a second processor to a computer, but it didn’t double the workload it handled. Natural inefficiencies meant that 1+1 was approximately 1.5 or maybe 1.75 times the workload. Today, multiprocessing and multithreading is so common that even the Windows calculator takes advantage of the benefits. So, when I look at the recent acquisition of Tripwire by Fortra, how do...</description>

    <summary>Spring Framework is a hugely popular Java application framework, often used in self-contained Spring boot applications, but traditionally often deployed as an application in a servlet container such as Tomcat. A critical vulnerability exists in Spring framework for endpoints that uses data binding to bind requests to Java objects (“POJOs”). This has the potential to lead to remote code execution by passing malicious request parameters to the application. There are publicly available exploits for certain conditions and reports of attacks being performed. Truesec believes other malicious payloads with different behavior will be developed in the near future. A patch has been released by Spring</summary>
